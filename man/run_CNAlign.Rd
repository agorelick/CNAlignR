\description{
Determine purity and ploidy values for multiple tumor samples with shared ancestry. This function uses the GuRoBi solver to determine purity/ploidy values for each sample that will *maximize* the number of segments with the same (allele-specific) integer copy numbers in at least rho% of samples.
